# About

I’m an Adjunct Professor at the Departamento de Matemática, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL), and researcher at CEMAT-ULisboa, 
where my focus is on Numerical Analysis, particularly in Computational Fluid Dynamics and Water Waves modeling.

Lately, I’ve been also developing research in Industrial Mathematics, working closely with Portuguese companies and institutions through supervising internships and collaborative projects.

During my PhD, I created DOLFWAVE, a FEniCS-based library (C++ and Python) designed to solve surface water wave problems.
